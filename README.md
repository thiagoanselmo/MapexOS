# üåê MapexOS

**MapexOS** is an open-source, modular IoT operating system designed to unify device communication, rule automation, and edge/cloud deployment under a single extensible platform.

## üë§ About Me

Hi! I'm **Thiago Anselmo**, a software engineer and entrepreneur with over 16 years of experience building high-impact solutions ‚Äî from scalable web systems to industrial-grade IoT platforms.

I'm the founder of **MAPEX**, a company born to develop cutting-edge technology. Our first software product is **MapexOS**, and we‚Äôre proud to launch it as a **100% open-source platform** ‚Äî designed to empower developers, integrators, and businesses around the world.

## üìñ Why MapexOS?

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked with platforms like **ChirpStack** and **ThingsBoard**, which have helped shape the IoT ecosystem. While powerful, these platforms fall short when applied to **real-world, scalable, multi-tenant environments** ‚Äî especially when simplicity, extensibility, and enterprise integration are required.

Here‚Äôs what drove me to create **MapexOS**:

- ‚ùå **No native SSO or identity integration** in ChirpStack ‚Äî hard to scale securely across teams or customers  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ThingsBoard offers a rule engine**, but it's heavily based on **Node-RED-style flows**, which require **technical knowledge** of protocols and internal message structures ‚Äî making it **inaccessible to non-developers**  
- ‚ùå **No first-class support for data lake storage**, especially common backends like **AWS S3** or **Delta Lake**  
- ‚ùå Protocol support is fragmented ‚Äî needing complex setups or external services to combine HTTP, MQTT, CoAP, and LoRaWAN  
- ‚ùå Difficult to customize or extend components (e.g., rule engine, alert system, data routing) without deep internal rewiring  
- ‚ùå Limited user experience for defining business logic or monitoring device state in a human-friendly way  

These challenges led to the vision behind **MapexOS** ‚Äî a truly **modular**, **open**, and **developer + business-friendly** IoT platform that lowers the entry barrier while increasing flexibility.

## üéØ What Makes MapexOS Different?

MapexOS is designed from day one to solve these pain points with:

- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-ready auth**: Native integration with **SSO**, **OAuth2**, **OIDC**, and **Keycloak**
- ‚úÖ **Data lake integration**: Built-in routing to **AWS S3** and future support for **Delta Lake**, **MinIO**, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Rule Engine**: Designed to be **intuitive for non-technical users**, while still giving developers the power to define advanced logic
- ‚úÖ **Unified Protocol Support**: Native ingestion of **HTTP**, **MQTT**, and **CoAP** (with **LoRaWAN** coming soon)
- ‚úÖ **Clear modular architecture**: Easy to extend, replace, or plug into any part of the pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Edge + Cloud-native**: Lightweight **Go-based ingestion**, with **NestJS** backend for business logic and event handling
- ‚úÖ **Built-in alerting & messaging**: Integrated with **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, and **webhooks** for real-time automation

## üöÄ Roadmap (WIP)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 ‚Äî Core Platform

- [x] Protocol ingestion modules (Go): HTTP, MQTT, CoAP
- [x] Backend API with NestJS
- [x] Frontend with Vue 3 + Quasar for:
  - Multi-tenancy management
  - Device and gateway registry
  - Event log visualization
  - Alert configuration (Slack, Teams, Telegram, Email)
  - Basic rule manager (UI)
- [x] Event routing via HTTP, RabbitMQ, or Kafka
- [x] Integration with Keycloak or compatible SSO
- [x] Friendly and intuitive UI for both developers and non-tech users

### üöß Phase 2 ‚Äî Advanced Intelligence & LNS

- [ ] Integration of a custom **LoRaWAN Network Server**
- [ ] Rule engine isolation using **JavaScript workers**
- [ ] Visual no-code environment for rule creation
- [ ] Advanced device profiling and dynamic configuration engine
